Explain the difference between Wait and Thread.sleep()
The wait and Thread.sleep() methods, commonly found in multi-threaded programming environments like Java, serve to pause thread execution but differ significantly in their purpose and behavior, particularly concerning monitor locks and inter-thread communication.
Thread.sleep() -
Purpose:  Pauses the execution of the current thread for a specified duration.
Monitor Locks:  Does not release any monitor locks held by the thread.  The thread retains ownership of any acquired locks.
Context:  Can be called from any ;part of the code, not necessarily within a synchronized block.
Resumption:  The thread automatically wakes up and becomes runnable after the specified sleep duration.  It can also be interrupted.
Usage:  Used for intrducing simple, timed delays in a thread's execution.
Wait() -
Purpose:  Causes the current thread to wait until another thread explicitly notifies it (using notify() or notifyAll()) or until a specified timeout expires.
Monitor Locks:  Releases the monitor lock on the object it is called upon.  This allows other threads to acquire the lock and potentially modify the shared resource.
Context:  be called withing a synchronixed block, as it operates on the object's monitor.
Resumption:  The thread resumes exectuion when it recevies a notify() or notifyAll() call for the object it's waiting on, or if the timeout expires, and it can reacquire the monitor lock.  It can also be interrupted.
Usage:  Primarily used for inter-thread communication and synchronization, where one thread needs to wait for a condition to be met by another thread.
