Explain the difference between Wait and Thread.sleep()
Both wait() and Thread.sleep() are used to pause the execution of a thread, but they are used for different purposes and behave differently.
1. Definition-
- wait() is a method of the object class and is used for inter-thread communication.
- Thread.sleep() is a method the Thread class and is used to pause a thread for a fixed time.
2. Lock Handling-
- wait() releases the lock(monito) on the object when it is called.
- Thread.sleep() does not release any lock the thread is holding.
3. Usage context-
- wait() must be called inside  synchronized block or method.
- Thread.sleep() can be called from anywhere and does not require synchronization.
4. Waking up the Thread-
- A thread in wait() state is awakened by calling notify() or notifyAll() on the same object.
- A thread in Thread.sleep() wakes up automatically after the specified time.
5. Purpose-
- wait() is used when threads need to communicate or coordinate with each other.
- Thread.sleep() is mainly used to introduce a delay in execution.
6. Exceptions-
- Both methods throw InterruptedException, which must be handled using try–catch or declared with throws.
