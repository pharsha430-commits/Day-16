| Condition based    | Yes, it waits for specific conditions                                   | No, it does not check any condition                    |

| Waiting time       | Waits only until the condition is met                                   | Waits for the full specified time                      |

| Best practice      | Use Explicit or Fluent Wait                                             | Avoid using in real-time projects                      |


Selenium Wait() -
- Selenium wait is used to handle synchronization issues in web applications.
- It waits dynamically until a web element becomes visible, clickable, or present.
- Selenium provieds implicit wait, explicit wait and fluent wait.
- It improves script reliability and reduces unnecessary delays.
- Selenium wait is highly recommended in real-time automation testing.

Thread.sleep() -
- Thread.sleep() is a java method used to pause program execution for a fixed time.
- It does not depend pn element availability.
- Even if the element loads early, the program still waits.,
- It makes automation scripts slow and unstable.
